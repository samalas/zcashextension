# Shield Wallet - Investor Pitch Talking Points

## 🎯 Executive Summary

**Shield** is the first privacy-focused DeFi wallet Chrome extension for Zcash, addressing a critical gap in the market where desktop users have been underserved. We're building the infrastructure to bring Zcash into the DeFi ecosystem while maintaining its core privacy principles.

---

## 💰 Market Opportunity

### 1. **Untapped Desktop Market**
- **Problem**: Zashi (leading Zcash wallet) is mobile-only, leaving desktop users without a native solution
- **Opportunity**: 60%+ of crypto users prefer desktop wallets for DeFi interactions
- **Market Size**: Zcash has ~$500M market cap with growing institutional adoption
- **Desktop DeFi Gap**: No browser-based Zcash wallet exists for DeFi applications

### 2. **Privacy + DeFi Convergence**
- Privacy coins are seeing increased adoption (regulatory clarity, institutional demand)
- DeFi market is $50B+ and growing
- **First-mover advantage**: We're the first to combine Zcash privacy with browser-based DeFi access
- **Timing**: Perfect intersection of privacy demand and DeFi infrastructure maturity

### 3. **Developer Ecosystem**
- Zcash lacks developer tooling compared to Ethereum
- We provide RESTful API infrastructure that enables dApp development
- **Network effects**: More developers → more dApps → more users → more value
